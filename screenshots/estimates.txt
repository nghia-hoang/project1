1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
I think of Multi-AZ as having an RTO of 1-2 minutes
    
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
        ◦ 00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
        ◦ 00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
        ◦ 00:15 - team data base support starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
        ◦ 00:30 - team data base support find Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
        ◦ 00:35 - Remediation started (5 minutes) :  Promote read replication to be the new master and then route the traffic to the new endpoint
        ◦ 00:45 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)
       Total time: 45 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
As it only takes a 1-2 minutes to fail over to another AZ, 1-2 minutes of data will be lost.    
    
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
 Minimum RPO will equal with data is backed up.
